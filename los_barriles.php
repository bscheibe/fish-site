                    <h4>HISTORY</h4>The area around Cabo has been inhabited for at least 10000 years.  The first Europeans found primitive people in the area living on a subistence diet from hunting and fishing, and only using stone tools.
                    <br><br>The modern history of Los Barriles is about fishing. From the 1950s fisherman came to the East Cape area in enough numbers that a couple of hotels were built in Los Barriles and Buena Vista.  With the completion of Mexico Highway 1 in 1978, more fishermn were able to drive down the peninsula and experience the great fishing of Los Barriles and the East Cape.  Windsurfers also came south and found excellent sailing conditions in the winter months.
                    <br><br>
                      Today Los Barriles attracts Fishermen, Windsurfers, Kite Boarders, and Divers from all over the world.  Fisherman come fro the marling, tuna, and dorado that team in nearby waters.  Windsurfers and Kite Boarders come for the famous North Wind which blows from November thru March.  And Divers cherish the teeming waters of Cabo Pulmo Marine Park.
